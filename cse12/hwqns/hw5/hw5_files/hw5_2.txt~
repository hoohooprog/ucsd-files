The Gamma button would be Selection sort because not only does
the number of comparisons quadtruple after n doubles in size,
the number of comparisons is approximately squared the number of n.
In comparison Alpha and Beta do not have the number of comparisons
that is squared of n.

Since both Alpha and Beta are O(n^2) but since Beta takes lesser
time to finish running at increased number of elements, Beta would be Insertion sort
while Alpha would be bubble sort.

Since both epsilon and zeta are the fastest when randomized, I take them
to be either quicksort or mergesort. Since zeta has higher movements
and slightly faster than epsilon, I believe that zeta is mergesort,
since it is not an in-place algorithm thus requiring much more movement.
Epsilon is quicksort.

Therefore by process of elimination, Delta is checksort


-zeta is quicksort instead
-mergesort don't have to compare as much because it's a divide and conquer algorithm,
it splits into single elements before joining together by comparison while quicksort
is a in-place algorithm. It also explains why Epsilon and zeta are mergesort and quicksort respectively, because it is slower
than both alpha and beta during almost sort.
