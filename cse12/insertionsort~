        // insert numbers[i] into sorted part
        // stopping once numbers[i] is less than previous

    }

takes approx N times to insert the next element into the sorted part of the array.
worse case comparison is n^2
best case is N
best of elementary sorts, twice as fast as bubble and somewhat faster than selection
often used as the final stage of more sophisticated sorts(eg quicksort).
