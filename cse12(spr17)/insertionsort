in list of N elements, outer loop executes N-1 times/
inner loop needs to examine all elements in sorted part, hence executes N/2 times
worse case comparison is n^2
best case is N
best of elementary sorts, twice as fast as bubble and somewhat faster than selection
often used as the final stage of more sophisticated sorts(eg quicksort).
