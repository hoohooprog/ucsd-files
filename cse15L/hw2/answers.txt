1. After changing the file permissions from "--xr-xrw-" 
   to issuing the command "chmod ug+rw temp",
   both user and group will gain the ability to read and write files.
   Hence, users can read, write, and execute; group can read, write and execute
   ; others can read and write.

2. "chmod 421 temp" means that user gives user access to read only; user
   gives group access to write only; user gives others access to execute.

3. For find to be case-sensitive we need to type the command 'find . -name "*.java"'.

4. No. 127 means that the command is not found.

5. less

6. the letter 'd'.

7. chmod u+x hello.sh

8. The folder temp will appear at the home directory.

9. to undo "tar cvf Lab2.tar Lab2", write "tar xvf Lab2.tar".
   to undo "gzip -r Lab2", write "gunzip -r Lab2".

10. gzip compresses individual files while tar is needed to compress
    an entire folder before using gzip.

11. "echo" command echo the string(s) to standard output. In "$echo cat", the
    string "cat" is being output and displayed on the command line interface.
    "cat" command concatenate file(s), or standard input, to standard output;
    therefore, "cat echo" outputs "cat: echo: No such file or directory" because echo
    is not a file.
